# React Interview Preparation Modules

This repository is a collection of React Exercise Modules designed to help you prepare for frontend interviews. It includes practical, real-world problems and learning modules that cover essential React concepts and features. Each module is crafted to improve understanding, problem-solving, and implementation skills in React.

##Features:

###Exercise Modules:

Real-world scenarios like task management, shopping carts, stock watchlists, and more.
Focus on key React patterns such as state management, reducers, props drilling, and context.
Emphasis on dynamic UI updates, data filtering, and API simulation.

###Learning Modules:

Console-based exercises to deepen understanding of React's rendering flow.
Scenarios with useEffect, state updates, and dependency handling to understand the sequence of React lifecycle events.
Exercises to predict and debug console logs for better mastery of React behavior.
Whether you're preparing for interviews or honing your React skills, this repository provides a hands-on approach to mastering React concepts that are frequently asked in frontend interviews. Perfect for developers of all levels aiming to solidify their knowledge and build confidence for technical discussions.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
